# parallel_pollard_rho
Prime factorization is a very important concept for modern cryptography, especially for asymmetric cryptography such as RSA. These cryptographic protocols' security is largely guaranteed by the difficulty of factoring large composite integers. An algorithm that efficiently factors an arbitrary integer would render RSA-based public-key cryptography insecure. In practice, Pollard's rho algorithm is such a clear algorithm to handle prime factorization problem. In this project, a parallel version of Pollard's rho algorithm is proposed, in order to see if parallel computing is able to large accelerate the performance of the algorithm thus to put RSA-like cryptography in jeopardy. The proposed method is based on the process of picking numbers in Pollard's rho algorithm, so it is called Multiple Picks (MP). The method is then implemented on Knights Landing machine which is the 2nd generation of Intel's many integrated core architecture called Xeon Phi. For comparison, a existing parallel method is also implemented, which is called Different Paths (DP). The experiment results shows that MP is able to gain speedup over the sequential version of Pollard's rho algorithm, while it is still not able to really outperform DP.
